# Collector Mappings Feature Implementation

## Overview
The Collector Mappings feature extends the JSON to XML conversion utility to support creating XML tags from multiple JSON sources and conditional tag generation. This enhancement allows for more flexible and powerful XML generation capabilities.

## Core Changes

### 1. Mapping Class Extensions (`Mapping.java`)
- Added new fields to support collector functionality:
  - `isCollector`: Boolean flag indicating if mapping is a collector
  - `sourceFeedJPaths`: List of JSON paths serving as data sources
  - `conditionJPath`: Path used for conditional tag creation
  - `defaultValue`: Default value for derived fields

### 2. MappingGenerator Enhancements (`MappingGenerator.java`)
- Updated CSV processing to handle new collector-related columns
- Added support for parsing multiple source feed paths
- Enhanced mapping hierarchy construction for collector mappings
- Implemented sorting mechanism for maintaining XML element order

### 3. JsonToXmlSteam Improvements (`JsonToXmlSteam.java`)
- Added collector mapping processing logic
- Implemented derived field generation based on conditions
- Enhanced path resolution for both absolute and relative paths
- Added caching mechanism for condition evaluation
- Improved handling of different JSON node types (arrays, objects, primitives)

## New Features

### Collector Mappings
- Ability to gather data from multiple JSON sources:
  - Array items (e.g., `$.company.branchList[*]`)
  - Single objects (e.g., `$.company.mainBranch`)
  - Primitive values (e.g., `$.company.alternateBranchInfo`)
- Support for repeating XML structures based on collected data

### Derived Fields
- Conditional XML tag creation based on JSON path existence
- Default value specification for derived fields
- Efficient condition evaluation through caching

### Path Resolution
- Support for both absolute and relative JSON paths
- Special handling for current context references (".")
- Improved JSON pointer conversion

## Example Implementation

### Sample Files
- `example_collector.json`: Demonstrates various data source types
- `mappings_collector.csv`: Shows mapping configuration including:
  - Collector mappings with multiple source paths
  - Derived fields with conditions
  - XML structure definition

### Demo Implementation
- Created `DemoCollectorMapping.java` to showcase:
  - Loading and processing of collector mappings
  - Transformation of complex JSON structures
  - Generation of derived fields
  - Handling of multiple data sources

## Benefits
1. More flexible XML generation capabilities
2. Support for complex data transformations
3. Improved handling of conditional content
4. Better performance through caching
5. Maintainable and extensible architecture

## Technical Details
- Implemented caching for condition evaluation
- Added robust error handling
- Improved logging for debugging
- Enhanced documentation
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing mappings
